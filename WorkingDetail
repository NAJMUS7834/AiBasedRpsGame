Rock–paper–scissors is a zero-sum hand game usually played between two people,
in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an
outstretched hand. These shapes are ROCK (✊ a simple fist), PAPER
(✋ a flat hand), and SCISSORS (✌️ a fist with the index and middle 
fingers together forming a V). The game has only three possible outcomes other
than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has
chosen scissors (rock crushes scissors) but will lose to one who has played paper
(paper covers rock); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors 
(scissors cut paper). If both players choose the same shape, 
the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
